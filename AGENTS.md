# cyber-security - Agent Skills Repository
## AGENTS.md (Symlink to CLAUDE.md)

This repo contains cyber-security Agent Skills — folders of instructions, references, scripts, and assets that AI agents use to work more accurately. For detailed architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Repo Structure

```
manifest.json                   # Root source of truth — global config + skills array
skills/
├── index.json                  # Generated — agent-skills-discovery RFC index
└── <skill-name>/
    ├── SKILL.md                # Entry point — frontmatter + overview + reference index
    ├── references/             # Detailed reference docs (API guides, guidelines, etc.)
    ├── scripts/                # Helper scripts for the skill
    └── assets/                 # Static assets (CSS, images, etc.)
```

## Reference File Conventions

Every file in `references/` must have YAML frontmatter with three fields:

```yaml
---
name: "Human-Readable Title"
description: "One-line summary of the file's contents."
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

- **name**: Descriptive title (e.g., "Elements API", "Marketplace Guidelines")
- **description**: Single sentence summarizing what the file covers
- **tags**: Array of searchable keywords — include API method names, category terms, and key concepts

### Content style

- Plain markdown only — no JSX components (`<Tabs>`, `<Steps>`, `<Note>`, `<Frame>`, etc.)
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ` ```typescript `)
- Use markdown tables for structured data
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for callouts and notes
- End each reference with a "Best Practices" section where applicable
- Keep references focused on one API domain or topic per file

### When adding references from external docs

Source documentation often uses JSX/HTML components. Strip these when converting:

| Source component | Convert to |
|---|---|
| `<Tabs>` / `<Tab>` | Separate sections with `###` headings |
| `<Note>` / `<Warning>` | Blockquote (`>`) |
| `<Steps>` / `<Step>` | Numbered list with `###` sub-headings |
| `<Accordion>` | Standard markdown table or section |
| `<Frame>` / `<img>` | Remove (image URLs won't resolve in this context) |
| `<Button>` / `<a>` | Inline markdown link |

## SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description used for discovery and matching.
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  audience: target-audience
  workflow: reporting
  source: reference-standard
---
```

Common optional `metadata` fields seen in practice: `audience`, `workflow`, `source`, `year`, `standard`, `approach`, `tool-analogy`, `version`.

The SKILL.md should include:
- Quick start workflow
- Core API patterns with code examples
- Reference Documentation section linking to all files in `references/`
- Scripts and assets
- License information (must be an OSI-approved license)

## Scripts

- `node scripts/add-skill.js <name> "<description>"` — Scaffold a new skill
- `node scripts/sync-skills.js` — Sync manifest.json, platform plugin files, marketplace.json, skills/index.json, and README.md with skills directory

## Workflow

1. Add or edit reference files in `skills/<name>/references/`
2. Update `SKILL.md` reference links if files were added/removed/renamed
3. Run `node scripts/sync-skills.js` if SKILL.md frontmatter changed (updates manifest.json, platform plugin files, index.json, and README)

## Development

- **Always use conventional commit prefixes** (e.g. `feat:`).
- **Never force push, amend, or rewrite history** unless the user explicitly requests it and confirms. Force pushes can break release tracking and cause data loss.
- **Never push to `main` directly** unless the user explicitly asks. Default to creating a feature branch and opening a PR.
