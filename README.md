## Adding New Skills

Use the included script to add new skills:

```bash
node scripts/add-skill.js <skill-name> "<description>"
```

Example:

```bash
node scripts/add-skill.js owasp-top10-2025 "OWASP Top 10 2025 vulnerability knowledge and guidance. Use when discussing web app security, vulnerability assessments, or when user asks about OWASP, A01-A10, or specific risks like broken access control or supply chain failures."
```

This will create the skill structure and automatically update manifest.json, platform plugin files, skills/index.json, and this README.
